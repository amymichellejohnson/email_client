** Note:  I am currently attempting to add a function to create folders and store emails in the folders.  However,at at the current time this app only creates/stores/list emails. (This explains the presence of folder templates and controllers currently under construction)

INTRODUCTION
------------
The Email Client app allows users to list out all of the emails the user has, with just the sender's address and subject line showing, lets users click on an email to see the full body, and allows users to "send" emails, which essentially just creates a new message.This app can't actually send and receive messages.



MOTIVATION
------------
To practice using templates, controllers, an application template, models, and to practice storing data properly with ember.js.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
A computer with a Web Browser.


INSTALLATION
--------------
1. In terminal (for Macs) type:
``$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer``
2. Open localhost:8000 in your Web browser.

KNOWN BUGS
---------
No known bugs at this time.
